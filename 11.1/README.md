Overview: In this application, I explored a dataset through Kaggle. While the original dataset contained information on 3 million used cars, the provdided data set only contained 426,000, which is still quite alot. Our goal is to understand what factors a car dealer can objectively use to price their used cars more or less expensively. In order to frame this task, we used the standard process of CRISP-DM.

Here is the link to my findings, which I will reitorate below as well:

 Business Understanding: Our objective is to find what makes a used car most valuable. That is to say, what factors can used car dealers use in order to better price and thereafter sell their cars

Data Understanding/Preparation/Modeling: We looked at a very large dataset from Kaggle that contained information from over 426,000 cars. We then fine tuned that data and adjusted it slightly so that we may be able to work and manipulate it with code! For example, we removed missing values, or we filled in missing values with a mean value so that we could actually use that data column. After much manipulation, we see that the Regression model best used is the Linear Regression model. 

Evaluation/Deployment: As far as used cars go, if we look at the correlations, dealers should take a better look at which models of cars they are bringing in, as it seems to be the best way to yield the most money. Because of that the manufacteror kind of goes hand in hand with that, as only certain manu-s will make these certain models. Another thing I have noticed is that year is also kind of important. Models that of of recent years will be much more valuable than models that are much older.
